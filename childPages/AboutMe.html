 <h2 style="color:white;">Culture & Customs of the Turks </h2>
 <br>
 <h3 style="color:white;"> Turkish culture is very similar to Arabic culture, with more similarities than differences, but has undergone profound changes over the last century. Political, legal, religious, cultural, social, and economic policy changes were designed to convert the new Republic of Turkey into a secular, modern nation-state. Turkey's culture is divided in two ways, the modern secular nation-state and the old culture or rather fragments of it left from the Ottoman Empire. </h3>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h2 style="color:white;">Religion & Customs in Turkey </h2>
 <br>
 <h3 style="color:white;"> The main religion practised in Turkey is Islam, this can be seen from the architecture all around the country, no matter which city you are in while in Turkey you will see many famous mosques built as far as 400 years ago. Turkey does indeed have some customs that might seem unique or weird to tourists and others at first sight such as those Turkish eyes everywhere that are for warding off evil thoughts. It is hard to ignore the Turkish eyes that are everywhere in Turkey, from people’s homes to dangling from a taxi driver’s mirror. This good luck charm is believed to protect against everything from jealous neighbors to meddling in-laws. Then there are other customs that are just interesting like how in Turkey tea is a sign of hospitality. It may seem like Turks drink more tea than water, but the drinking of the ubiquitous Turkish tea is less about hydration and more about an invitation of hospitality and friendship. Tea at someone’s home usually happens after a meal and is often accompanied by fresh fruit and sweets.  </h3>

 <br>
 <h2 style="color:white;">Turkish Cultural Food (i.e. images and videos) </h2>
 <br>
 <h3 style="color:white;"> Because Turkish Culture is very diverse there are alot of delicious and unique cultural foods all around the country. The first cultural dish I want to talk about is baklava, dating back to the Ottoman Empire, baklava is one of the most iconic Turkish dishes and a must for anyone with a sweet tooth. This layered pastry is filled with nuts and covered in syrup and ground pistachios for an unforgettable Mediterranean dessert. You can find baklava in most bakeries and supermarkets, but it's best when freshly baked. Another cultural dish is Sarma, Sarma is an interesting dish it is made of vine, cabbage, monk's rhubarb, kale or chard leaves rolled around a filling of grains, like bulgur or rice, minced meat, or both. It is found in the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire from the Middle East to Southeastern Europe. You can find sarma all around Turkey it is a famous cultural dish that is absolutely worth giving a try. </h3>

 <br>
 <br>
 <h2 style="color:white;">Cultural Celebrations in Turkey </h2>
 <br>
 <h3 style="color:white;"> There are a lot of celevrations in Turkey but I am going to talk about 2 specific celebrations with the first one being, the Mevlana Whirling Dervishes Celebration that is celebrated by a festival, this festival celebrates the thoughts and recitations of the great Sufic saint and the 13th-century Sufi poet Jalaluddin Rumi. He was one of the world’s greatest philosopher and the father of the Mevlevi sect. The music, dance, listening and spiritual experience come together to enchant you during the dance of the Dervishes. The second celebrations is the Oil Wrestling Festival, this 600-year-old Kirkpinar Oil Wrestling Festival takes place in Edirne, Turkey. The tournament is open to everyone from all cultures, regions and ages without discrimination between religion, gender, language or race. Pehlivans are the participants, the patron launches the festival in the Kirkpinar Aga. This is an amazing ceremony where forty bands of drums and shawms join in to create the captivating atmosphere. Thereafter, the golden belt is carried through the city in a procession, followed by prayers recited in the Selimiye Mosque. </h4>
